It gives the current time at the top of the page 
It also allows time slots to be green if the time has not passed and red if the time has passed

requirements:
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar (DONE)

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours (DONE)

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
(PRETTY MUCH DONE BESIDES THE PRESENT)

WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
(DONE)
